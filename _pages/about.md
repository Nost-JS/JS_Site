Hailing from the beautiful landscapes and countryside of the west country of England, I am a physics graduate who endeavours to bring STEM skills to the media industry.

I have a great passion for most things technological and graphics based! This derives mainly from my interest in video games and modern filmographic media. As much as some people would know me as a gamer, I actually pride myself as much as a movie fan. I can never miss an opportunity to watch breath-taking action sequences, animated talent and simulated shots.   

In my free time, I enjoy creating cartoon illustrations to develop my creative eye alongside with building computers, investigating how they fundamentally are structured and communicate part for part.

Maths is also pretty cool. It's a common thing I can remember from secondary education that it's not a very liked subject but then when I started learning calculus and more core mathematics at A Levels, like complex numbers, matricies, functions, proof by induction and more, it's a massive staple of my life I can never let leave my side! So any chance to perform a bit of maths will always be of my interest!

A few other neat things in my life  involve my family and friends! I cherish you all and even if our paths may have crossed during our lives, I hope our memories last forever!

Oh! Not to mention my cute little feline friend: Pebbles!
