This project demonstrates the development of fundamental skills with Autodesk Maya.
The stimulus for the piece was to construct a scene of my choice including the artistic concepts of an animated bouncing ball interacting with the famous Penrose staircase artistic concept.

A notable inclusion to this piece was the utilisation of a python file to randomly distribute a selection of modelled geometry tiles. You can notice within the background that the scene is constructed by the same tile geometry however the position of their distribution is randomly decided per file execution. This allows for a more natural looking city landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed this project and am continuing to develop my understanding in the Maya software for simple geometry modelling and python utility, in addition to understanding the API behind the program's functionality.
