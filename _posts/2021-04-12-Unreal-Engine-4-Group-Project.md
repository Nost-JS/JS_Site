During early 2020, I had a deep passion to get my hands dirty in learning Unreal Engine 4 and understanding the perspective of game developer. Therefore for the group project section of the course, I had teamed up with 4 artists to create the game concept of "Cut The Sheep".

The game idea is simple! You play as an anthropomorphic wolf collecting "wool" from sheep using shears. Collect 10 wool and return to the starting point and you win! Get caught by Papa Sheep and you lose!

My responsibilities for the project involved liaising and regular communication between all the artists to receive their assets, compile them inside the engine and implement any necessary game logic. Examples include:
- Animation programming (State machines)
- AI Programming
- Player character mechanics
- Level Programming and HUD
- Combining Model Assets using given character rig
- Packaging the final deliverable

One main issue we had during our time developing the game was the project management, hence why various assets look incomplete. This was unfortunate as many of our team was falling ill during very crucial weeks of progress.

Regardless, the team remained punctual and tenacious to get what they could get done, done. Big shoutout to them for all their time and effort and was great fun to work on such a project!
