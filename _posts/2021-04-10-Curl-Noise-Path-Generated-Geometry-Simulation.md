This simulation utilises the concept of Curl Noise bound to a pre-set geometry, which in this case is the default Rubber Toy (from SideFX), to generate geometry along a path. Such a tool would be ideal for creating non-natural effects or some form of worm propagating magic of sorts.

Voxels and VDB were implemented alongside with curl noise VOP nodes. Curl Noise is an adaption of Perlin Noise combined with vector calculus parameters to create moments of low data divergence and vortex looking effects.

I found the Houdini software really fun to use! Hoping to develop further scenes and tools in future. I have a small passion for pyro dynamics coming from thermodynamics background of a physics degree.

During the time this simulation was in development was around the same time COVID 19 began to heavily affect education institutes and working from home became a standard. I initially found this a trouble coming having to move back home away from educational facilities, but am glad I managed to push through this project!
